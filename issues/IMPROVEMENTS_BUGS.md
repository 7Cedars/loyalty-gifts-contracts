## Loyalty Gifts - Solidity contracts 
**Example implementation of Loyalty Gift Contracts**

This repository is meant as initial playground to develop some examples of Loyalty Gift Contracts, following the protocol as outlined in the readme file.  

## Idea and Design
- Each contract is an instance of the LoyaltyGift interface.  
- A requirementsLoyaltyGiftMet function in the contract defines a logic on which gifts can be transferred.   
- Function are either tokenised - giving out vouchers that can be redeemed later - or simply respond with 'true' if requirements are met (and revert when not met).  
- Function can take points, but they can also draw on any other (external) input.
